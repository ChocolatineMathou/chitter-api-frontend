# Chitter Frontend Challenge

The scenario oh this weekend challenge is quite similar as the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/ChocolatineMathou/chitter-challenge) I worked on few days ago using Ruby and Sinatra.  
This time, we are provided with a backend API and our mission is to build a single page application. 

## Technology

At the moment, I would like to add an extra challenge to this project and use React. I may (or may note) re-evaluate this idea by the end of the day.

## Install and run the app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your favourite browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!
