# Chitter Frontend Challenge

The scenario oh this weekend challenge is quite similar as the [Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/ChocolatineMathou/chitter-challenge) I worked on few days ago using Ruby and Sinatra.  
This time, we are provided with a backend API and our mission is to build a single page application. 

## Technology

At the moment, I would like to add an extra challenge to this project and use React â€” you can call me crazy. I may (or may note) re-evaluate this idea by the end of the day. :dizzy_face:

## User stories

```
As a Maker
So that I can see what others are saying  
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order

As a Maker
So that I can let people know what I am doing  
I want to post a message (peep) to chitter

As a Maker
So that I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to sign up for Chitter

As a Maker
So that only I can post messages on Chitter as me
I want to log in to Chitter

As a Maker
So that I can avoid others posting messages on Chitter as me
I want to log out of Chitter
```

## Install, run and test the app

Before running the app, make sure [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed.  

To download and run the app:  

``` 
$ git clone git@github.com:ChocolatineMathou/chitter-api-frontend.git  
$ cd chitter-api-frontend  
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
`npm install` will get you all dependencies needed to run this project.  
`npm start` may redirect you automatically to your favourite browser. If not, open it and type `http://localhost:3000`.  
`npm test` will launch the tests.
